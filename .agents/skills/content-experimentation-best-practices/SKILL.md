# Content Experimentation Best Practices

Principles and patterns for running effective content experiments to improve conversion rates, engagement, and user experience.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Setting up A/B or multivariate testing infrastructure
- Designing experiments for content changes
- Analyzing and interpreting test results
- Building CMS integrations for experimentation
- Deciding what to test and how

## Core Concepts

### A/B Testing
Comparing two variants (A vs B) to determine which performs better.

### Multivariate Testing
Testing multiple variables simultaneously to find optimal combinations.

### Statistical Significance
The confidence level that results aren't due to random chance.

### Experimentation Culture
Making decisions based on data rather than opinions (HiPPO avoidance).
